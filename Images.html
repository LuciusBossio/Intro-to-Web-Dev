			<figure>
				<img src = "./imgs/Aphid.jpg" height = "270" width = "207" alt = "Aphid"/>
				<figcaption>Wingless aphid</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Aphids are sap sucking insects, most do not have wings. The nectar they produce is fed on by ants, ants are a good indicator of an aphid infestation.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class = "imagespagemainflexitem">
			<figure>	
				<img src = "./imgs/Botrytis.jpg" height = "270" width = "207" alt = "Botrytis"/>
				<figcaption>Botrytis infected cola</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Botrytis typically affects large colas where flower density is high. Regularly inspect bud sites, particularly late in flower.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class = "imagespagemainflexitem">
			<figure>	
				<img src = "./imgs/Caterpillar.jpg" height = "270" width = "207" alt = "Caterpillar"/>
				<figcaption>Caterpillar on flower</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Caterpillars typically eat leaves, however, they also end up on flowers where they get stuck to trichomes, die, and cause bud rot.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class = "imagespagemainflexitem">
			<figure>
				<img src = "./imgs/Grasshopper.jpg" height = "270" width = "207" alt = "Grasshopper"/>
				<figcaption>Grasshopper on stem</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Grasshoppers are voracious eaters, just one can eat through a stem and sever a plant in half. Scout for grasshoppers daily.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class = "imagespagemainflexitem">
			<figure>	
				<img src = "./imgs/Mites.jpg" height = "270" width = "207" alt = "Spider Mites"/>
				<figcaption>Spider mite symptoms</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>There are many types of mites. They all cause similar damage, except for spider mites, which form a web that can suffocate plant tissue.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class = "imagespagemainflexitem">
			<figure>	
				<img src = "./imgs/PM.jpg" height = "270" width = "207" alt = "Powdery Mildew"/>
				<figcaption>Powdery mildew</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>At this stage powdery mildew will spread so rapidly that it cannot be contained without using banned pesticides. The best treatment is prevention.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class = "imagespagemainflexitem">
			<figure>	
				<img src = "./imgs/RootRot.jpg" height = "270" width = "207" alt = "Root Rot"/>
				<figcaption>Fan leaf death caused by root rot</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Root rot is not easy to detect if growing in soil, once symptoms are visible rot has already set in and the plant will be permanently hampered. Do not overwater.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class = "imagespagemainflexitem">
			<figure>	
				<img src = "./imgs/Virus.jpg" height = "270" width = "207" alt = "Tobacco Mosaic Virus"/>
				<figcaption>Plant infected by tobacco mosaic virus</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Tobacco mosaic virus has no known cure at this point in time. Scouting for TMV is essential, once symptoms are detected the plant must be destroyed immediately to prevent it from spreading. The sooner the better.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class = "imagespagemainflexitem">
			<figure>
				<img src = "./imgs/WhiteFly.jpg" height = "270" width = "207" alt = "White Fly"/>
				<figcaption>Mature white flies and larvae</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>White flies typically feed on the underside of leaves, which is where you can find their larvae. Do not wait to find them flying around, scout the undersides of leaves for early detection.</p>
